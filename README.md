The shell, therefore, is the part of the command processor that accepts commands. After verifying that the commands are valid, the shell sends them to another part of the command processor to be executed."_ [Taken from Wedopedia](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/shell.html)

It might be a bit more advanced, and might be a big confusing to beginners. I would use what you understand, and keep what you don't understand tucked away in the back of your midn for when you do. See especially [A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds) and [Naming Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions).

> "_A Turing machine is an idealised computing device consisting of a read/write head (or 'scanner') with a paper tape passing through it. The tape is divided into squares, each square bearing a single symbol--'0' or '1', for example. This tape is the machine's general purpose storage medium, serving both as the vehicle for input and output and as a working memory for storing the results of intermediate steps of the computation._"
